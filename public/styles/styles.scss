// SASS Directory structure
//|___________________________________________________________________
//|-- modules/              # Common modules
//| The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.
//|   
//|   ...
//|___________________________________________________________________
//|-- partials/             # Partials
//| The partials directory is where the meat of the CSS is constructed.
//|
//|   ...
//|   _presentation/scss    # element appearance - background color...
//|   _structure.scss       # where the core system strucutre is developed
//|	  _visibility.scss      # hide and show for devices
//|___________________________________________________________________
//|-- vendor/               # CSS or Sass from other projects
//| The vendor directory is for third-party CSS. This is handy when using prepackaged components developed by other people (or for your own components that are maintained in another project). jQuery UI and a color picker are examples of CSS that you might want to place in the vendor directory. As a general rule I make it a point not to modify files in my vendor directory.
//|   ...
//|___________________________________________________________________
//| -- style.scss            # primary Sass file
//| The main Sass file will be very clean using the aforemitioned directory structure. Thus said Sass files will be called with @import.
